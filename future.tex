\section{Future work}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{The future of \Queso}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \Queso\ works closely with the DAKOTA team at Sandia
      \begin{itemize}
        \item They provide feedback on our design
        \item They request features
        \item They find bugs
        \item We learn from their (software and optimisation) expertise
        \item DAKOTA can link to \Queso\ for inference
        \item DAKOTA has a large userbase
      \end{itemize}
    \item We have funding from Sandia to:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Improve the sampler interface to improve and ease maintainability
          for new and existing MCMC algorithms
        \item Implement a generic vector/matrix interface so we can have
          higher performance vector implementations
        \item Usability, user-friendliness, and licensing improvements
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
